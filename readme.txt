This CF7 plugin extension will bring the best of both – Contact Form 7 and PayPal – in merely one-click process. The extension can be of great help for WordPress site owners to embrace fast online payment facility on their web portals.

Using this Contact Form 7 – PayPal Extension, you can easily embrace PayPal fields in your Contact Form 7. Indeed this extension can add a real value to WordPress sites seeking secure, quick online payment integration. Sounds like a new emerging trend which is there to stay long, isn’t it?

Using this plugin, you can add ‘PayPal submit button’ in the form which will take the necessary information from the form fields and redirect users on the PayPal’s website so they can proceed for a secure payment. The payment is made once you submit the form. This can really speed up your online payment.
